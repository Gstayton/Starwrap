Starbound Wrapper


A simple wrapper made in Python to help introduce new features for Starbound servers.

Currently introduces a (crude) playerlist, by simply typing players into the server terminal.

To install, simply drop the files into the root directory of Starbound, and have Python 3.3 available on your system.

Finally got Mac support, I think. Still needs more testing across all platforms, especially Mac. If you decide to start using this and get any errors, let me know ASAP and I'll work with you to fix them!
