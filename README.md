Starbound Wrapper


A simple wrapper made in Python to help introduce new features for Starbound servers.

Currently introduces a (crude) playerlist, by simply typing players into the server terminal.

To install, simply drop the files into the root directory of Starbound, and have Python 3.3 available on your system.

Currently no Mac support (Mostly due to me having a Mac to test it on), but it's mostly there, just need to solve a few
small tidbits. Get ahold of me if you intend to host on mac, and I can probably fix it the same day.
